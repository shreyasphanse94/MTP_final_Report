Subgraph isomorphism is used in many real world problems such as chemical compounds, social networks, and biological structures. Many real applications in bio-informatics, chemistry, and software engineering require efficient and effective management of graph structured data.

One of most important graph queries in graph databases is the subgraph isomorphism query. That is, given a query q and a data graph g, find all embeddings (matches) of q in g. This problem is NP-hard. Various popular algorithms that have tried to solve the problem in reasonable amount of time.

With the development of GPUs and the number of cores, there has been a huge increment in amount of parallelism achieved and therefore increasing the speed up and performance of algorithm. In this project, we have tried to parallelise subgraph isomorphism algorithm and compare it with the sequential implementation. We have studied the scenarios where each of these implementations outperform each other
